  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 5, 2025</p>

  <p>
    The <strong>İşte Odak</strong> app has been developed and released free of charge by Mehmet Akif Kara. This page is intended to inform users of the app about our policies regarding the collection, use, and protection of personal data.
  </p>

  <h2>📌 Personal Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    This application does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal data in any way.
  </p>
  <p>
    It operates entirely on your device as a local time management tool. No data is sent to any server or external service.
  </p>

  <h2>📂 Technologies Used</h2>
  <p>
    The app uses only <strong>Shared Preferences</strong> (local storage) to maintain the continuity of the timer and stopwatch when the app is closed and reopened.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Stored data:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is kept only on your device</li>
    <li>Is not shared outside the app</li>
    <li>Is not synced with any person or system</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔒 Security</h2>
  <p>
    Since the app does not use any network connection or internet access, there is no risk of external data breaches. Your data stays entirely on your device and is not shared with the outside world.
  </p>

  <h2>👶 Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This app is not specifically designed for children under the age of 13. However, since no personal data is collected, it does not include any content that violates children's privacy.
  </p>

  <h2>🔗 Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app does not use any third-party services such as Firebase, advertising SDKs, or analytics tools.
  </p>

  <h2>🍪 Cookies</h2>
  <p>
    This app does not use cookies or any web-based tracking systems.
  </p>

  <h2>🔄 Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    If new features are added to the app in the future, this privacy policy may be updated. Changes will be shared on this page with the updated date. Users are responsible for reviewing this policy periodically.
  </p>
